## Idea

Fuel price comparison engine.

Users are able to add gas stations to database, including station name and adress.
If gas station is stored in database, users can input fuel prices, including: 
fuel type (PB95/PB98/ON/LPG), price, date.
Stations can be searched and prices can be edited. Fuel price shown to user is always the most recent one.
Users receive points every time they enter fuel price. It is possible to check score and entered prices history on "User profile" page.

## To do
Although the basic functionality is working in the app, there are still many things to do:
* editing prices (now only possible by entering new price),
* reporting issues,
* picking location from map (Bing Maps API),
* more search filters,
* user roles,
* fuel price statistics,
* searching for stations near users' location

## Technologies

* Node.js,
* Express.js,
